# Task Automation

Task automation works with GNU Make.

## Top-level tasks

### `make check`

Run all checks.

### `make install`

Run `make install` for each tool that has its own `Makefile`.

### `make remove`

Run `make remove` for each tool that has its own `Makefile`.

## `pre-commit` tasks

### `make pre-commit-check`

Check all files with `pre-commit`.

## Tool-specific tasks

See the `Makefile` or `README` in each tool's directory.
