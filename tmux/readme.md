# tmux dotfiles

Create a symlink `$HOME/.tmux.conf` -> `tmux.conf`.

On OSX, use `^a + fn + up/down` on the MBP keyboard or `^a + [ + pgup/pgdn` on a
PC keyboard to scroll up and down.

In OSX Terminal.app, make sure:

* `$TERM` is set to `xterm-256color` as in
  * the default profile
  * the [Solarized
    Profiles](https://github.com/altercation/solarized/tree/master/osx-terminal.app-colors-solarized/xterm-256color).
