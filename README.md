# Dotfiles

An attempt at making portable configuration files for programs that I frequently
need to configure.

Files are organized by program.  See the `README` in each directory for details
on how to apply its configuration.

## TODO

- [ ] Add `.symlink` files and install script
- [ ] Describe distinction between `.zsh` and `.sh` files
